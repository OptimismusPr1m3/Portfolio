    Since 2022, I've been enrolled in a part-time Bachelor's program in
    "Informatik", immersing myself in the diverse aspects of technology.
    Currently, I'm also undergoing an intensive Bootcamp program specializing in
    Frontend Development, aiming to further refine my practical skills and
    accelerate my growth. This dual educational journey has equipped me with a
    good theoretical foundation and strong practical insights into current
    industry practices.

    My nursing background since 2016 has enhanced my teamwork and adaptability
    skills. Working in healthcare emphasized collaboration, communication, and
    staying composed under pressure. These qualities, along with empathy and
    problem-solving abilities, are assets I bring to my role as a Frontend
    Developer, ensuring effective collaboration and client-focused project
    delivery.
