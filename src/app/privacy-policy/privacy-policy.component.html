    <h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>
    <h3>Data Protection</h3>
    <p>
      The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data
      very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in

      policy. When you use this website, various personal data are collected.
      Personal data are data with which you can be personally identified. This

      also explains how and for what purpose this is done. We would like to
      point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by
      e-mail) may have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of the
      data against access by third parties is not possible.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>
      General Information on Legal Basis for Data Processing on this Website
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you have given consent to data processing, we process your personal
      data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories
      of data are processed according to Art. 9(1) GDPR. In the event of
      explicit consent for the transfer of personal data to third countries,
      data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented
      to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g.,
      via device fingerprinting), data processing additionally occurs based on §
      25(1) TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary
      for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of
      pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
      Furthermore, we process your data if necessary to fulfill a legal
      obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also occur
      based on our legitimate interests according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Relevant
      legal bases for each individual case are provided in the following
      paragraphs of this privacy policy.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Note on Data Transfer to Privacy-Insecure Third Countries and Transfer to
      US Companies not Certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF)
    </h3>
    <p>
      We use tools from companies based in privacy-insecure third countries as
      well as US tools whose providers are not certified under the EU-US Data
      Privacy Framework (DPF). When these tools are active, your personal data
      may be transferred to and processed in these states. We would like to
      point out that in privacy-insecure third countries, a level of data
      protection comparable to that of the EU cannot be guaranteed. We also note
      that the USA, as a safe third country, generally has a level of data
      protection comparable to that of the EU. Accordingly, data transfer to the
      USA is permissible if the recipient holds certification under the "EU-US
      Data Privacy Framework" (DPF) or has appropriate additional guarantees.
      Information on transfers to third countries, including data recipients,
      can be found in this privacy policy.
    </p>
    <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
      In the course of our business activities, we collaborate with various
      external entities. This may necessitate the transfer of personal data to
      these external entities. We only disclose personal data to external
      entities if necessary for contractual fulfillment, if legally required
      (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate
      interest under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in the disclosure, or if another legal
      basis permits data disclosure. When using data processors, we only
      disclose personal data of our customers based on a valid data processing
      agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement
      is concluded.
    </p>
    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent for Data Processing</h3>
    <p>
      Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
      consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. The legality of the data
      processing carried out prior to the revocation remains unaffected by the
      revocation.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct
      Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>
      If data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR, you have the
      right to object to the processing of your personal data for reasons
      arising from your particular situation, including profiling based on these
      provisions. The respective legal basis for data processing can be found in
      this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your
      personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for
      the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the
      processing serves the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims
      (objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR). If your personal data is
      processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at
      any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing,
      including profiling related to such direct marketing. If you object, your
      personal data will subsequently no longer be used for direct marketing
      purposes (objection pursuant to Art. 21(2) GDPR).
    </p>
    <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
    <p>
      In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to
      lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the member
      state of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged
      infringement. This right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to
      other administrative or judicial remedies.
    </p>
    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you
      have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable
      format, and have the right to transmit those data to another controller
      without hindrance from us, provided that the processing is based on
      consent or a contract and is carried out by automated means. Where
      technically feasible, you also have the right to have the personal data
      transmitted directly from us to another controller upon request.
    </p>
    <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
    <p>
      Within the framework of applicable legal provisions, you have the right to
      free information about your stored personal data, its origin and
      recipients, and the purpose of data processing at any time, as well as a
      right to correct or delete this data. For this purpose and for any other
      questions regarding personal data, you can always contact us.
    </p>
    <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your
      personal data. You can contact us at any time to exercise this right. The
      right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we
        usually need time to verify this. During the verification period, you
        have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal
        data.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the processing of your personal data was/were unlawful, you can
        request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it/them for the
        exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to
        request the restriction of processing of your personal data instead of
        deletion.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have objected pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balancing of
        interests between yours and ours must be made. As long as it is not yet
        determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
        restriction of processing of your personal data.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data
        – except for their storage – may only be processed with your consent or
        for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the
        protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for
        reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member
        state.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4. Data Collection on This Website</h2>
    <h3>Contact Form</h3>
    <p>
      If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your information from the
      inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will be
      stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of
      follow-up questions. We do not disclose this data without your consent.
      The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your request
      is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the
      implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
      processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing
      of the inquiries sent to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art.
      6(1)(a) GDPR) if requested; the consent can be revoked at any time. The
      data entered by you in the contact form will remain with us until you
      request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose
      for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after completion of processing
      your inquiry). Mandatory legal provisions – in particular retention
      periods – remain unaffected.
    </p>
    <h3>Inquiry via Email, Telephone, or Fax</h3>
    <p>
      If you contact us by email, telephone, or fax, your inquiry including all
      resulting personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us
      for the purpose of processing your request. We do not disclose this data
      without your consent. The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b)
      GDPR if your request is related to the performance of a contract or is
      necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other
      cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective
      processing of the inquiries sent to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your
      consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if requested; the consent can be revoked at
      any time. <br />
      <br />
      The data you submit to us via contact inquiries will remain with us until
      you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for
      data storage ceases (e.g., after processing your inquiry is completed).
      Mandatory legal provisions - especially statutory retention periods -
      remain unaffected.
